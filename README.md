##  About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various Python programming.

##  Problem Categories

###  Matrix Operations
- **Latin Squares** - Validating mathematical structures with specific constraints
- **Queen Movement** - Chess-based coordinate systems and attack patterns  
- **Diagonal Patterns** - Creating matrices with distance-based values

###  Pattern Generation
- **ASCII Art** - Generating visual patterns with characters
- **Matrix Transformations** - Transposition and symmetry operations

##  Featured Solutions

### Latin Square Validator
```python
# Checks if an n×n matrix contains each number 1 to n
# exactly once in every row and column
# A fascinating mathematical concept with practical applications
```

### Chess Queen Attack Pattern  
```python
# Visualizes all squares a queen can attack on an 8×8 board
# Takes chess notation input (e.g., 'e4') and shows attack zones
# Great exercise in coordinate transformation
```

### Diagonal Distance Matrix
```python
# Creates a matrix where each element equals its distance 
# from the main diagonal - elegant mathematical pattern
```
